   - [Debian Download](https://www.debian.org/distrib/)
   - [Ubuntu Download](https://ubuntu.com/download)
2. Download the **minimal ISO** version of your preferred operating system.
3. Install the ISO on your VPS or computer:
   - For physical machines, create a bootable USB with the ISO.
   - For VPS, upload the ISO and follow the provider’s instructions.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation, choosing a minimal or base installation without additional packages.

CWD SYSTEMS Linux
=================

This Kernel is a custom-built, highly secure kernel developed by CWD SYSTEMS, designed to provide advanced protection against modern cyber threats. Utilizing cutting-edge techniques in cybersecurity, it offers unmatched resilience with features such as real-time threat monitoring, kernel hardening, and low-level attack prevention. Its architecture is optimized for high-speed performance and stealthy operations, making it ideal for sensitive environments like blockchain nodes, data centre solutions, and secure communication platforms. By integrating CWD Gate for encrypted tunnel endpoints, it ensures unparalleled data security and anonymity in today's increasingly hostile digital landscape.

```bash
Easy Automated Install

git clone https://github.com/infinitydaemon/Opsec-Kernel-x64.git
Opsec-Kernel-x64
chmod +x automate.sh
sudo ./automate.sh
```

```bash
For Desktop Environments

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infinitydaemon/OpSec-Kernel-x64/main/build-desktop.sh
chmod +x build-desktop.sh
./build-desktop.sh
```
This script automates the build and installation process of the CWD Desktop Optimized Kernel, designed
specifically to enhance performance, security, and stability for desktop environments. The preemptive 
model is dynamic, prioritizing tasks based on the needs of front-end applications. It seamlessly 
transitions to allocate resources to background tasks when required. This design is ideal for desktop 
environments where front-end applications rely heavily on backend services.

The configurations include:

Reduced Latency: Fine-tuned for low-latency performance, ensuring a responsive user
experience even under heavy workloads.

Enhanced Scheduler: Optimizes CPU task scheduling for desktop use cases, improving
multitasking efficiency and application responsiveness.

Security Hardening: Integrated advanced security features to protect against both
known and emerging threats, with a focus on preventing privilege escalation and unauthorized access.

Memory Management Optimization: Tweaked memory handling to enhance performance and reduce
swapping, providing a smoother experience on resource-intensive applications.

I/O Optimization: Improved I/O scheduling algorithms to reduce bottlenecks during disk-intensive
operations, making file transfers and application loading faster.

This kernel is ideal for users who demand a secure, fast, and reliable desktop computing environment.
```bash
For Server Environments

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infinitydaemon/OpSec-Kernel-x64/main/build-server.sh
chmod +x build-server.sh
./build-server.sh
```
This script is designed to automate the build and installation of the CWD Server Optimized Kernel, tailored
specifically for environments that demand high performance, reliability, and advanced security.

The configurations include:

Optimized for Background Processes: The kernel is fine-tuned to efficiently handle numerous background 
processes, ensuring smooth operation for server workloads, from web hosting to complex data processing.

Enhanced Compute Task Performance: Optimized for intensive compute tasks, making it ideal for applications 
like machine learning, data analysis, and high-frequency trading.

Crypto Acceleration Framework: Integrated support for crypto acceleration, enabling faster encryption and 
decryption processes, crucial for secure communications, blockchain operations, and cryptographic workloads.

Blockchain Hardware Support: Additional support for specialized hardware used in blockchain environments, 
including but not limited to GPU offloading, FPGA integration, and optimized cryptographic algorithms, 
making it a prime choice for blockchain nodes and minters.

Hardened Memory Algorithms: Advanced memory management and hardening techniques are implemented to enhance 
stability and security, reducing the risk of memory leaks and attacks, and ensuring maximum uptime.

Data Center Ready: This kernel is built for deployment in professional data center environments, such as AWS,
Vultr, and other cloud platforms. Its architecture is designed to maximize resource utilization, reduce latency, 
and provide a stable foundation for mission-critical applications.

Extra Features:

Adaptive Resource Allocation: The kernel dynamically adjusts resource allocation based on real-time workloads, 
ensuring optimal performance for critical tasks without compromising on background processes. The kernel further
enhances performance by continuously scanning memory allocation units. It identifies unused address spaces and 
efficiently reallocates the corresponding registers back to the memory pool. This proactive management reduces 
memory fragmentation, optimizing resource usage and lowering latency on the system bus. By minimizing unnecessary 
memory usage, the system maintains higher overall efficiency, leading to smoother and faster operation, especially 
under heavy workloads. This mechanism not only boosts performance but also contributes to more stable and 
predictable system behavior.

Scalable Security: With built-in support for advanced security frameworks, this kernel offers scalable security 
solutions that grow with your infrastructure, from single-server setups to extensive cloud-based environments.

Future-Proofing: Regular updates and an architecture designed with future technological advancements in mind 
ensure that your infrastructure remains cutting-edge and capable of handling the latest developments in server 
technology.

Deploy the CWD Server Optimized Kernel to power your enterprise applications with the performance, security, and reliability needed in today’s fast-paced digital landscape.

After all stages of the build process are completed, proceed to reboot by answering "Yes."

```bash
uname -rs to verify if the kernel is loaded and activated.
```
Proceed to Stage 2 to enable hardened TCP/IP settings.

```bash
cd Opsec_Kernel_x64
chmod +x stage2-hardening.sh
./stage2-hardening.sh
```
Perform a reboot to active the applied settings.
